# Predicting-DTIs-using-edge2vec
In this project, we predict drug-target interactions from a heterogeneous network with various types of nodes and edges by employing a novel node embedding method called Edge2vec and by the use of an SVM classifier for predicting all of the pairs of drugs and proteins.
## Step 1
### Data gathering and preparation
The pioneer step for these problems is data gathering. Regarding the validation of [DTINet](https://github.com/luoyunan/DTINet) dataset has consisted of several drug-related databases, I think it would seem to have more precise results. I used these files for my project:

`drug.txt`
`protein.txt`
`disease.txt`
`se.txt`
`mat_drug_se.txt`
`mat_protein_protein.txt`
`mat_protein_drug.txt`
`mat_drug_protein.txt`
`mat_drug_drug.txt`
`mat_protein_disease.txt`
`mat_drug_disease.txt`
