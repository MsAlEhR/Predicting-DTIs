# Predicting-DTIs-using-edge2vec
In this project, we predict drug-target interactions from a heterogeneous network with various types of nodes and edges by employing a novel node embedding method called Edge2vec and by the use of an SVM classifier for predicting all of the pairs of drugs and proteins.
# STEP 1
## Data gathering and preparation
The pioneer step for these problems is data gathering. Regarding the validation of [DTINet](https://github.com/luoyunan/DTINet)
